Class template for constructing a word graph of left factors a word in a f.p. semigroup.

This page describes the class :any:`StephenPresentationWords` which implements Stephen's
procedure for constructing the :any:`WordGraph` corresponding to the left
factors of a word in a finitely presented semigroup or a finitely presented
inverse semigroup. The algorithm implemented in this class is closely related
to the Todd-Coxeter algorithm (as implemented in :any:`ToddCoxeterWord`) and
originates in :cite:`Stephen1987aa`.

:any:`StephenPresentationWords` inherits from :any:`Runner`.
