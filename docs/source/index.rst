Python bindings for the C++ library libsemigroups
-------------------------------------------------

What is ``libsemigroups``?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``libsemigroups`` is a C++14 library containing implementations of several
algorithms for computing finite and finitely presented semigroups. Namely:

- the `Froidure-Pin algorithm`_ for computing finite semigroups
- the `Todd-Coxeter algorithm`_ for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
- the `Knuth-Bendix algorithm`_ for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
- the `Schreier-Sims algorithm`_ for permutation groups;
- a preliminary implementation of the Konieczny_ and Lallement-McFadden_
  algorithm for computing finite semigroups which act on sets.

``libsemigroups_pybind11`` is a python package exposing much (but not all) of
the functionality of ``libsemigroups``.

The development version of ``libsemigroups_pybind11`` is available on github_,
and some related projects are here_.

See the installation instructions:

The structure of the module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Python module ``libsemigroups_pybind11`` was designed to mirror the C++
library ``libsemigroups`` as closely as possible, whilst navigating the
fundamental difference between Python and C++. This is done with the help of the
tool `pybind11 <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

For various implementational reasons (mostly related to Python's lack of an
analogue for C++'s templating system), the Python code exposed by ``pybind11``
is less streamlined and concise than the C++ library. To try and address this,
the authors of ``libsemigroups_pybind11`` have further wrapped the Python code
produced by ``pybind11`` to make the Python and C++ user experience as similar
as possible.

The Python bindings of the ``libsemigroups`` code produced by ``pybind11``
reside in an intermediate module called ``_libsemigroups_pybind11`` (note the
leading underscore), and the public-facing nicely wrapped code resides in this
module â€” ``libsemigroups_pybind11``.

Should this impact the way you, the user, use ``libsemigroups_pybind11``? For
the most part, no. It should be possible to use ``libsemigroups_pybind11`` in
the ways documented on this site without the knowledge that
``_libsemigroups_pybind11`` even exists. The notable exceptions to this relate
to type names and error messages. A lot of the code in
``libsemigroups_pybind11`` has been imported from ``_libsemigroups_pybind11``,
and this is visible in qualified type names. For example:

.. doctest:: python

    >>> from libsemigroups_pybind11 import WordGraph
    >>> WordGraph
    <class '_libsemigroups_pybind11.WordGraph'>

Additionally, some functions or classes in the ``_libsemigroups_pybind11``
module have additional prefixes and suffixes relative to their
``libsemigroups_pybind11`` counterpart. These usually relate to the module that
the function or class is contained within or a type the function or class is
defined upon. These may appear in error messages. For example:

.. doctest:: python

    >>> from libsemigroups_pybind11 import aho_corasick, AhoCorasick
    >>> ac = AhoCorasick()
    >>> aho_corasick.add_word(ac, False)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: aho_corasick_add_word(): incompatible function arguments. The following argument types are supported:
        1. (ac: _libsemigroups_pybind11.AhoCorasick, w: list[int]) -> int
        2. (ac: _libsemigroups_pybind11.AhoCorasick, w: str) -> int
    <BLANKLINE>
    Invoked with: <AhoCorasick with 1 node>, False

The :doc:`authors <authors>` of ``libsemigroups_pybind11`` have gone to a lot of
effort to try and make error messages clear, specific and intelligible; however,
if there you encounter any errors with unclear messages, please raise this on
the
`issue tracker <https://github.com/libsemigroups/libsemigroups_pybind11/issues>`_.
