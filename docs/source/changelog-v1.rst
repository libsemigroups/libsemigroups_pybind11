Changelog - version 1
=====================

v1.0.1 (released 13/08/2025)
-----------------------------

This is a minor release that adds some missing files to the PyPI source.

v1.0.0 (released 12/08/2025)
-----------------------------

This is a major release that significantly expands the API of
``libsemigroups_pybind11`` to expose much of the functionality implemented in
version 3 of libsemigroups_. The extent of the changes made in this release
means that it is likely that any code written with earlier versions of
``libsemigroups_pybin11`` will no longer work.

The structure of ``libsemigroups_pybind11`` is very tightly linked to the the
structure of libsemigroups_. Therefore, some of the differences between
v0.10.1 and v1.0.0 of ``libsemigroups_pyind11`` will be related to the
differences between v2 and v3 of libsemigroups_, such as changes to class names
and interfaces. These changes can be found in the
`libsemigroups changelog <https://libsemigroups.github.io/libsemigroups/md_changelog-v3.html>`_.
