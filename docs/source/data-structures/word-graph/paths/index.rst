Paths
=====

This page contains links to the documentationin ``libsemigroups_pybind11`` for
finding and counting paths in a word graph. The relevant classes are:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    paths

..
    Decided to not make bindings for paths::algorithm, and number_of_paths, or
    cbegin_pislo etc since their functionality is exposed by Paths.
