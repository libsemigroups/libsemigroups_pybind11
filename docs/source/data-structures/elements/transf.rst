Transformations
===============

This page contains the documentation for functionality in
``libsemigroups_pybind11`` for transformations in the :py:class:`Transf1`
class.

These transformations are optimised for the number of points in the image with
fewer points requiring less space per point.  

.. If ``libsemigroups`` has been
.. compiled with ``HPCombi`` enabled, then transformations with degree at most 16
.. use the SSE and AVX instruction sets for very fast manipulation.

There are numerous functions for computing things about :py:class:`Transf1`
objects detailed below.
