.. py:function:: inverse(f: PPerm1 | Perm1) -> PPerm1 | Perm1
  
   Returns the inverse of a partial perm or permutation.
  
   This function returns a newly constructed inverse of *f*. The *inverse* of
   a partial permutation ``f`` is the partial perm ``g`` such that ``fgf =
   f`` and ``gfg = g``.
  
   :param f: the partial perm.
   :type f: PPerm1 | Perm1
   
   :complexity: Linear in the degree of *f*.
   
   :returns: The inverse of *f*.
   :rtype: PPerm1 | Perm1 

.. py:function:: domain(f: Transf1 | PPerm1 | Perm1) -> List[int]
  
   Returns the set of points where a partial transformation is defined.
   
   Returns a ``List[int]`` containing those values ``i`` such that:

   * :math:`i\in \{0, \ldots, n - 1\}` where `n` is the degree of *f*; and
   * ``f[i] != UNDEFINED``.
   
   :param f: the transformation.
   :type f: Transf1 | PPerm1 | Perm1
   
   :complexity: Linear in the degree of *f*.
   
   :returns: The sorted list of points in the domain.
   :rtype: List[int] 
   
.. py:function:: image(f: Transf1 | PPerm1 | Perm1) -> List[int]

   Returns the set of points in the image of a partial transformation.
   
   Returns a ``List[int]`` containing those values ``f[i]`` such that:

   * :math:`i\in \{0, \ldots, n - 1\}` where `n` is the degree of **f**; and
   * ``f[i] != UNDEFINED``.
   
   :param f: the transformation.
   :type f: Transf1 | PPerm1 | Perm1
   
   :complexity: Linear in the degree of **f**.
   
   :returns: The sorted list of points in the image.
   :rtype: List[int] 

.. py:function:: right_one(f: PPerm1) -> PPerm1
  
   Returns the right one of a partial perm.
  
   This function returns a newly constructed partial perm with degree equal
   to that of **f** that fixes every value in the image of **f**, and is 
   :any:`UNDEFINED` on any other values.
   
   :param f: the partial perm.
   :type f: PPerm1

   :returns: The right one of ``f``.
   :rtype: PPerm1

   :complexity: Linear in the degree of **f**.

.. py:function:: left_one(f: PPerm1) -> PPerm1

   Returns the left one of a partial perm.
  
   This function returns a newly constructed partial perm with degree equal
   to that of **f** that fixes every value in the domain of **f**, and is 
   :any:`UNDEFINED` on any other values.
   
   :param f: the partial perm.
   :type f: PPerm1

   :returns: The left one of ``f``.
   :rtype: PPerm1

   :complexity: Linear in the degree of **f**.
