Partial perms
=============

This page contains the documentation for functionality in
``libsemigroups_pybind11`` for partial permutations in the :py:class:`PPerm1`
class.

These partial permutations are optimised for the number of points in the image
with fewer points requiring less space per point.  

.. TODO(0) use somewhere?
.. If ``libsemigroups`` has been
.. compiled with ``HPCombi`` enabled, then partial permutations with degree at most 16
.. use the SSE and AVX instruction sets for very fast manipulation.

There are numerous functions for computing things about :py:class:`PPerm1`
objects detailed below.
