Permutations
============

This page contains the documentation for functionality in
``libsemigroups_pybind11`` for permutations in the :py:class:`Perm1` class.

These permutations are optimised for the number of points in the image with
fewer points requiring less space per point.  

.. TODO(0) If ``libsemigroups`` has been compiled with ``HPCombi`` enabled, then
   permutations with degree at most 16 use the SSE and AVX instruction sets for
   very fast manipulation.

There are numerous functions for computing things about
:py:class:`Perm1` objects detailed below.
