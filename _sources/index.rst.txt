libsemigroups_pybind11 - Version 0.1.8
======================================

python bindings for the C++ library libsemigroups
-------------------------------------------------

What is ``libsemigroups``?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``libsemigroups``  is a C++14 library containing implementations of several
algorithms for computing finite and finitely presented semigroups. 
Namely:

- the `Froidure-Pin algorithm`_ for computing finite semigroups
- the `Todd-Coxeter algorithm`_ for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
- the `Knuth-Bendix algorithm`_ for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
- the `Schreier-Sims algorithm`_ for permutation groups;
- a preliminary implementation of the `Konieczny`_ and
  `Lallement-McFadden`_  algorithm for computing finite
  semigroups which act on sets.

``libsemigroups_pybind11`` is a python package exposing much (but not all) of
the functionality of ``libsemigroups``. 

The development version of ``libsemigroups_pybind11`` is available on github_,
and some related projects are here_.
